# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener intermittently fails to trigger when authentication status changes. The listener is essential for managing user sessions and providing a seamless user experience.  The inconsistency makes it difficult to manage the application state properly.

## Reproducing the Issue

The exact conditions for reproducing the bug are not consistently clear; however, observations indicate that it may be related to network conditions or rapid authentication changes.  The provided `authListenerBug.js` file contains a simplified example of how the listener is implemented.  Observe the console logs to see the intermittent failure.

## Solution

The `authListenerSolution.js` provides a potential solution which may not fix the problem on all environment but fixes the problem on most environment.  Additional strategies for handling transient network issues, such as retry mechanisms or more robust state management, could further enhance reliability.  Please refer to Firebase documentation for best practices and alternative approaches for authentication management.
